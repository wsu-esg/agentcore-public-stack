# Requirements Document: RAG Ingestion Stack

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for creating a new independent RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) ingestion stack that is a carbon copy of the existing AppApiStack RAG implementation, but deployed as a separate, modular stack. The new stack will reuse the same Dockerfile (`backend/Dockerfile.rag-ingestion`) and implementation code, establishing an identical parallel deployment that can be verified before migrating away from the AppApiStack implementation.

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Create NEW stack with IDENTICAL functionality to existing RAG implementation
- Reuse SAME Dockerfile and code (no code changes)
- Deploy as SEPARATE stack with DISTINCT resource names
- Existing AppApiStack RAG resources remain UNCHANGED and OPERATIONAL
- Once verified, existing RAG resources can be removed from AppApiStack in a future phase

**Important:** This spec creates NEW resources in a NEW stack using the SAME implementation. The existing RAG resources in AppApiStack will remain operational and unchanged. No resources will be removed from AppApiStack as part of this work.
