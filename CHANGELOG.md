## [1.0.0-beta.25] - 2026-05-11

Production-readiness fix for the BFF Token Handler shipped in beta.24. Fixes three production-breaking bugs introduced by beta.24: event-loop-blocking sync boto3 on every cookie-bearing request, per-process AES-256 keys that can't round-trip cookies across ECS tasks, and an in-process-only refresh lock that races Cognito rotation across replicas. Also ships PDF thumbnails, rich attachment previews, spreadsheet analysis tools, centralized 401 handling, and a `SKIP_AUTH` local-dev bypass.

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Critical (beta.24 regression):** `SessionRefreshMiddleware` ran sync boto3 (DynamoDB + Cognito) on the uvicorn event loop so Angular's ~8-endpoint page-load fan-out produced ~16 serialized blocking AWS calls per user per minute. Observable as ALB 504s, 15.6s p-max `TargetResponseTime` at 0.7% CPU, `/files/quota` outliers reaching ~80s. Every boto3 call in `SessionRepository` and `CognitoRefreshClient.refresh` now offloads via `asyncio.to_thread`; `_resolve_session` is wrapped in a per-session `asyncio.Future` single-flight so N concurrent same-session callers share one loader invocation; `_maybe_slide` dispatches `touch_last_seen` as a detached `asyncio.Task` (with strong reference on the middleware to prevent GC); `_DEFAULT_SLIDING_RENEWAL_THROTTLE_SECONDS` raised 60s → 300s to de-align from the 60s refresh-leeway window (#264)
- **Critical (beta.24 regression):** `CookieCodec` called `kms:GenerateDataKey` on first use per process, so each app-api task minted its own random AES-256 key. Once `desiredCount` went above 1, cookies sealed on Task A failed as `bad seal` on Task B (~50% of requests). Data key is now generated once via Secrets Manager `generateSecretString` (44-char, ~261 bits entropy) encrypted at rest with the existing `BFFCookieSigningKey` CMK; `CookieCodec._ensure_cipher` reads the secret and derives the AES-256 key via SHA-256; `kms:GenerateDataKey` dropped from the runtime task role (#273, #274)
- **Critical (beta.24 regression):** In-process `single_flight` and `get_session_lock` only coalesce same-session callers within one Python process. Under multi-replica, two tasks could each call `cognito-idp:initiate_auth` with the same refresh token; Cognito rotates on the winner and the loser silently logs the user out. New DDB conditional-write lock (`try_acquire_refresh_lock` / `release_refresh_lock` on `BFFSessionsTable`, reusing the existing `dynamodb:UpdateItem` grant) elects exactly one leader fleet-wide; followers poll the row and adopt the leader's tokens. `update_tokens` gains strict-owner condition (`refresh_lock_owner = :owner`) that atomically `REMOVE`s the lock attrs on successful persist and rejects stale-leader stomps via `ConditionalCheckFailedException`. Absolute-lifetime guard added ahead of lock acquisition so we don't burn a Cognito refresh on a row that's about to TTL-evict (#273, #275)
- Per-message cost double-count on tool-use turns — Strands' `AgentResultEvent` cumulative `accumulated_usage` overwrote the last assistant message's per-call usage via `.update()`. Route the result-extracted cumulative on the `metadata_summary` turn-summary track instead of `metadata` (#270)
- Context-% inflation within a tool turn — Bedrock reports each per-LLM-call `inputTokens` as the full context sent on that call, so Strands' summed `accumulated_usage` over-reports. `stream_coordinator` no longer accumulates `metadata_summary` into `accumulated_metadata`; per-call `metadata` last-write-wins so the value equals the most recent call's full input = current context. Summed across `inputTokens` + `cacheReadInputTokens` + `cacheWriteInputTokens` since `AgentResult.context_size` under-reports by 99%+ under prompt caching (#270)
- `LatencyMetrics.time_to_first_token` changed from `int` (placeholder 0) to `Optional[int]` (placeholder `null`) — a real TTFT can't be 0ms and aggregations need to distinguish absence from a real value (#270)
- Session-expired mid-session left users stranded with a generic toast or no feedback on SSE. Every 401 now flows through `SessionService.handleUnauthorized()`, which dedupes concurrent calls and navigates once with preserved `returnUrl` (#277)
- Session loss not surfaced until the next HTTP call failed. Added cookie-presence fast-path (JS-readable `__Host-bff_csrf` cookie absence implies `__Host-bff_session` also gone) and visibility re-probe on tab refocus (#277)
- Login & first-boot lava-lamp backdrop dark-mode CSS never applied on cold load — `html.dark .X` selectors don't match under Angular's emulated view encapsulation, and `ThemeService` was never injected in the pre-auth tree. Switched to `:host-context(html.dark) .X` and forced `ThemeService` construction via `provideAppInitializer` (#271)
- XLSX→CSV filename mismatches in the Code Interpreter sandbox triggered retry loops. Targeted error hints, tolerant filename matching for CSV↔XLSX aliasing, schema footer preservation on errors

### 🚀 Added

- Server-rendered PDF page-1 thumbnails on attachment cards. New `ThumbnailRenderer` MIME-dispatcher (PDF today via `pypdfium2`, lazy-cached `_thumb.png` sibling in S3, render runs in `loop.run_in_executor`); new `GET /files/{upload_id}/thumbnail` returning a short-lived presigned URL; single-file + session-cascade deletes clean up thumbnails. Frontend: `FileUploadService.getThumbnail()` returns a typed `ready` / `unsupported` / `unavailable` result; PDF badge renders `object-cover` (#263)
- Rich previews in user messages — iMessage-style image mosaic (1-bubble / 2-col / 1+2 split / 2×2 / 5+ with `+N` overlay) with full-screen lightbox + arrow-key navigation; document-style cards for non-images with tinted header + folded corner + content excerpt. New `GET /files/{upload_id}/preview-url` and `GET /files/{upload_id}/text-snippet` (first 2KB UTF-8) (#254)
- Inline markdown preview for `.md` files in attachment cards; full-screen modal viewer via `ngx-markdown` instead of opening raw source in a new tab (#262)
- Spreadsheet analysis tools — `list_spreadsheets` enumerates CSV/XLSX across KB + attachments (with size + MIME metadata); `analyze_spreadsheet` runs Python analysis in Code Interpreter with schema detection (skiprows probing), cleaned pandas/numpy tracebacks, and 10K/600-char output/error truncation. Injected per-request via `extra_tools` (#f88ce7ec, #0ab90bb1)
- `SKIP_AUTH=true` local-dev bypass in `apis.shared.auth.dependencies` returns a fake admin user from all three auth dependencies. Optional tuning: `SKIP_AUTH_ROLES`, `SKIP_AUTH_USER_ID`, `SKIP_AUTH_EMAIL`. Startup guard in `app_api/main.lifespan` refuses to boot when `SKIP_AUTH=true` is paired with any non-localhost entry in `CORS_ORIGINS`. Inference-api intentionally not bypassed (all SPA traffic flows through app-api) (#272)
- New CI workflow `.github/workflows/skip-auth-guard.yml` greps CDK source, workflow files, and Dockerfiles for `SKIP_AUTH=true` / `SKIP_AUTH: true` patterns and fails the build if any leak into deployed config. SHA-pinned `actions/checkout`, `ubuntu-24.04` (#272)
- `SessionRepository.try_acquire_refresh_lock(session_id, owner, lock_ttl_seconds)` and `release_refresh_lock(session_id, owner)` for cross-task refresh coalescing (#273, #275)
- `apis/shared/sessions_bff/single_flight.py` — new `resolve_once(session_id, loader_coro_factory)` primitive for in-process coalescing of the session-resolve path (#264)
- CAUTION comment in `stream_coordinator` documenting that `AgentResult.context_size` / `EventLoopMetrics.latest_context_size` return only `inputTokens`, under-reporting by 99%+ under prompt caching (#270)

### ✨ Improved

- File metadata utilities (`backend/src/apis/shared/files/models.py`) for consistent attachment handling — `FileMetadata`, `FileContent`, size formatting, MIME-type inference — shared between routes and the chat-input component
- Spreadsheet-analysis system prompt clarifies filename vs. sandbox-path handling; tool docstrings expanded with critical guidance on retries
- Stream processor error handling for Code Interpreter responses is more defensive
- Updated `test_session_refresh_preservation.py`'s `InstrumentedTable` to differentiate lock-acquire / token-persist / slide writes so `update_item_side_effect` injection only fires on the persist path (preserving original test intent) (#273)

### 🔒 Security

- `kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:DescribeKey` dropped from the app-api runtime task role (least privilege). Only `kms:Decrypt` remains, invoked by Secrets Manager on the caller's behalf when reading the CMK-encrypted `BFFCookieDataKeySecret` (#274)
- `SKIP_AUTH=true` gated by boot-time CORS-origin allowlist + CI guard workflow; fails closed for any deploy target we haven't anticipated instead of blocklisting known cloud env vars (#272)

### ⚡ Performance

- `SessionRefreshMiddleware` resolve path now coalesces Angular's ~8-endpoint page-load fan-out to 1 `get_item` and 0 `update_item` on the critical path (previously ~16 serialized blocking AWS calls per user per minute). Response latency independent of `touch_last_seen` DDB latency after the `_maybe_slide` fire-and-forget refactor (#264)
- `CookieCodec` initialization dropped from `kms:GenerateDataKey` + per-cold-start round trip to a one-shot Secrets Manager `GetSecretValue` + local SHA-256. No more per-task cold-start KMS call (#274)
- Thumbnail render runs in `loop.run_in_executor` so the request worker isn't blocked; lazy `_thumb.png` sibling in S3 means steady-state thumbnails are a HEAD + presign, not a render (#263)

### 🏗️ Infrastructure

- New `BFFCookieDataKeySecret` (Secrets Manager, encrypted with `BFFCookieSigningKey` CMK); SSM parameter `/${projectPrefix}/auth/bff-cookie-data-key-secret-arn` publishes the ARN
- App-api task role: added `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` on the new secret; removed `kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:DescribeKey` on `BFFCookieSigningKey`; kept `kms:Decrypt`
- `appApi.desiredCount` raised 1 → 2 — concurrency slack so a single blocked event loop can no longer halt all ingress

### 📦 Dependencies

- Backend: `strands-agents` 1.37.0 → 1.39.0, `strands-agents-tools` 0.5.1 → 0.5.2, new: `pypdfium2` (#265, #263)

### 🧪 Test Coverage

- `tests/apis/shared/middleware/test_session_refresh_bug_condition.py` (12 cases) — encodes the seven sub-conditions of the event-loop-blocking bug as Hypothesis properties. Fails on unfixed code (by design); passes on fixed code (#264)
- `tests/apis/shared/middleware/test_session_refresh_preservation.py` (19 cases) — locks in 11 preservation invariants that must remain unchanged for non-buggy inputs (#264)
- `tests/apis/shared/sessions_bff/test_single_flight.py` (6 cases) — primitive-level coverage for the new `resolve_once` module (#264)
- `tests/apis/shared/sessions_bff/test_session_refresh_cross_task.py` (480 lines) — two-task integration coverage over moto DDB for the cross-task refresh lock, follower-polling/adoption, TTL recovery, headline invariant that two tasks racing in parallel call Cognito at most once (#273)
- 8 new repository tests for the lock primitive (acquire on unlocked row, contention blocks peer, TTL recovery, distinct-session isolation, release-by-owner-only, atomic clear on token persist, condition fails when peer owns the lock, phantom-row-prevention on acquire, strict-owner release condition, absolute-lifetime guard ahead of refresh) (#273, #275)
- `tests/agents/main_agent/streaming/test_per_message_cost_attribution.py` — three regression cases for the `metadata` vs `metadata_summary` contract; two parametrized cases for `stream_coordinator` current-context semantics including all-three-buckets-summed under cache-read/write (#270)
- `tests/costs/test_calculator.py` — 26 cases of direct coverage for `CostCalculator` (per-bucket pricing, cache scenarios against Sonnet 4.5 rates, defensive missing-key / None handling, `calculate_cache_savings`, `validate_*` predicates) (#270)
- `tests/auth/test_skip_auth.py` — `SKIP_AUTH` dependency-bypass + env-override coverage, startup guard allowlist behavior, skip-auth-guard.yml regex matches (#272)
- Session-wide autouse fixture in `tests/conftest.py` scrubs `SKIP_AUTH_*` env so developer `.env` bleed doesn't silently turn on the bypass in test runs (#272)
- Infrastructure-stack tests: dropped bootstrap-custom-resource assertions; added negative lock that no `AwsCustomResource` emits `kms:GenerateDataKey` / `secretsmanager:PutSecretValue`; positive assertion on `generateSecretString` shape (44-char, no punctuation, no space); fixed two pre-existing stale resource-count assertions (16→18 DDB tables, 3→6 secrets) (#273, #274)

## [1.0.0-beta.24] - 2026-05-06

### 🚀 Added

- BFF Token Handler: cookie-based auth replacing `localStorage` Bearer tokens. Opaque session id in a `__Host-bff_session` httpOnly cookie sealed with AES-GCM under a KMS-wrapped data key; Cognito tokens stored server-side in `BFFSessionsTable`; confidential `CognitoBFFAppClient` (secret in Secrets Manager) for server-side code exchange; `SessionRefreshMiddleware` silently refreshes Cognito tokens; `CSRFMiddleware` enforces double-submit tokens on unsafe methods
- BFF auth routes on app-api: `GET /auth/login` (Cognito PKCE, optional `identity_provider` + `return_to`), `GET /auth/callback`, `GET /auth/session`, `POST /auth/logout` (returns `{post_logout_url}` so the SPA bounces through Cognito Hosted UI to clear the upstream session)
- Cookie-authenticated `POST /chat/stream` SSE proxy to inference-api `/invocations`; owns the `httpx.AsyncClient` lifecycle so headers flush immediately; forwards `OAuth2CallbackUrl` for tool-side OAuth consent scoping; `_build_upstream_url()` percent-encodes the AgentCore Runtime ARN as a single path segment and appends `?qualifier=DEFAULT`
- CloudFront `/api/*` behavior with a viewer-request prefix-strip function; SPA fallback scoped to S3 via a separate viewer-request function so API errors pass through unchanged
- Sliding session lifetime: cookie `Max-Age` and DDB row TTL bump on every successful resolution, capped at `BFF_SESSION_ABSOLUTE_LIFETIME_SECONDS` (default 30 d) and throttled by `BFF_SESSION_SLIDING_RENEWAL_THROTTLE_SECONDS`
- Voice mode WebSocket-ticket proxy on app-api: `POST /voice/ticket` + WebSocket `/voice/stream` with HMAC ticket codec, DynamoDB replay store, and per-text-frame `auth_token` / `user_id` injection on the upstream relay (#211, #233)
- Per-conversation cost + context-window badge above the composer, backed by write-time aggregation on the session row; color-graded SVG ring with tooltip showing underlying token counts including cache reads and writes (#223)
- Context compaction SSE event surfaced inline as an "Earlier messages summarized" indicator with cumulative turn count; rehydrates after refresh via `totalSummarizedTurns` on the session-metadata GET (#243)
- Per-model inference parameters with canonical-name translation to provider-native shapes; Anthropic extended thinking via `supportedParams.thinking` with budget validation and temperature/top_p/top_k suppression (#203)
- Settings → Advanced panel for per-request inference-param overrides, persisted in sessionStorage
- Frosted-glass login card with primary-color blob backdrop; respects `prefers-reduced-motion` (#246)
- `GET /admin/auth-providers/cognito-redirect-uri` for admin-only Cognito domain lookup (replaces the retired `/config.json` fetch)
- XLSX-specific RAG chunker with header-row heuristics that skip title/banner rows; multi-sheet name prefix preserves context across embeddings
- Batched S3 Vectors writes (50 vectors per batch) to prevent request-body-size failures on large embedding batches
- AST-based architectural boundary tests enforcing `inference_api`, `agents/`, `apis.shared`, and `app_api` import rules (#200)
- New infrastructure: `BFFSessionsTable`, `BFFCookieSigningKey` (KMS), `CognitoBFFAppClient` + secret, `VoiceTicketReplayTable`, `VoiceTicketSigningSecret`
- `CognitoConfig.supportedIdentityProviders` (env `CDK_COGNITO_SUPPORTED_IDPS`) so the BFF client can federate beyond COGNITO
- `.env.example` now documents Cognito and BFF Token Handler env vars (previously zero coverage)

### ✨ Improved

- BFF refresh-token rotation hardened: rotation writes retry up to three times with 50/100 ms backoff and fail closed if every attempt fails; no-rotation responses take a single best-effort write
- `CookieCodec` promoted to a process-wide singleton so the `/auth/callback` seal and `SessionRefreshMiddleware` unseal use the same KMS-derived key
- SSE proxies (`/chat/stream` and `/chat/api-converse`) now own the upstream `httpx.AsyncClient` lifecycle and close it in the generator's `finally` block so headers flush immediately (#217)
- BFF callback seeds the Users row directly from ID-token claims (`email`, `name`, `picture`, `custom:roles` / `cognito:groups`); fixes first-login users missing email and falling back to Cognito provider-group roles
- Anonymous-user 401 lands on SPA `/auth/login` (with `returnUrl`) instead of Cognito Hosted UI; 401 toasts suppressed while the redirect is in flight (#228)
- `LoginPage` now redirects authenticated users to `returnUrl` instead of requiring a manual Sign In click (#226)
- Migrated `APP_INITIALIZER` to Angular 19+ `provideAppInitializer`; bootstrap's 401 path now hangs the promise so the SPA can't render during the queued redirect (#226)
- Angular build defaults to production via `defaultConfiguration`; `ng serve` defaults to development
- `scripts/gen-version.js` prebuild hook reads the monorepo root `VERSION` file and emits `src/version.ts` so the bundle carries the committed version
- Cost-badge pricing sums per-message metadata (matching the persisted C# records) and includes `cacheReadInputTokens` + `cacheWriteInputTokens` in context-window occupancy
- Compaction state lazy-loads on the AgentCoreMemory existing-session path; prevents default-zero writes overwriting persisted counters on refresh
- `ChatStateService` seeds cost / context signals from session metadata on route change; clears stale state before new metadata loads
- Legacy sessions lazy-backfill `totalCost` and `lastContextTokens` on first read — no migration script required
- `ToolAccessService` catalog now sources from DynamoDB via `freshness.get_all_tool_ids`; admin create/update/delete invalidate the snapshot
- Google's `initiate_consent` path always sends `prompt=consent` so Disconnect/Reconnect actually re-issues a refresh token (#245)
- In-process token cache gained a TTL (default 3000 s) so AgentCore Identity's refresh flow gets a chance to run before the upstream 3600 s lifetime (#210)

### ⚠️ Changed

- **Breaking:** SPA-facing routes no longer accept `Authorization: Bearer`. Cookie auth is required. External callers must migrate to the BFF session flow or hit `/chat/agent-stream` (Bearer-only) instead
- **Breaking:** `POST /chat/stream` is now the cookie-authenticated BFF proxy. The legacy in-process agent loop moved to `POST /chat/agent-stream` for API-key and scripted callers
- **Breaking:** SPA `/auth/callback` route removed. The BFF callback at `${appApiUrl}/auth/callback` is the only OAuth landing
- **Breaking:** SSM parameters `/auth/cognito/app-client-id` and `/oauth/callback-url` deleted. Consumers must migrate to `/auth/cognito/bff-app-client-id` and register a per-system callback URL
- Public PKCE Cognito client decommissioned; `InferenceApiStack`'s runtime authorizer and `AppApiStack`'s `COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID` repoint to the BFF client
- `/config.json` runtime fetch retired; `appApiUrl`, `version`, and `cognitoDomainUrl` resolved via build-time injection + a dedicated admin endpoint
- `ConfigService` collapses to a thin signal accessor over `environment.appApiUrl`; `inferenceApiUrl`, `cognitoAppClientId`, `cognitoRegion`, and `environment` fields removed from `RuntimeConfig`
- `apis.app_api.costs`, `apis.app_api.tools.models`, `apis.app_api.storage`, and `apis.app_api.auth.api_keys` moved to `apis.shared.*`. Out-of-tree imports must update (#200)
- `lastTemperature` on `SessionPreferences` and `isReasoningModel` on `ManagedModel` removed; Pydantic v2 `extra="ignore"` handles legacy rows (#203)
- CloudFront origin `readTimeout` capped at the 60 s default max (was 180 s, which failed `InvalidRequest` on distribution update)
- CodeQL and Dependabot workflows retargeted from `develop` to `main` (#247)

### 🐛 Fixed

- CloudFront distribution-wide `errorResponses` rewrote `/api/*` 4xx into 200 + `index.html`; Angular `HttpClient` choked parsing HTML as JSON (#230)
- BFF chat proxy was calling the AgentCore Runtime data plane with the ARN unencoded and no `qualifier`; 404 on every `POST /chat/stream` (#231)
- `CDK_CERTIFICATE_ARN` missing from frontend synth/deploy jobs caused the `/api/*` origin to fall back to `HTTP_ONLY`, breaking same-origin `__Host-` cookie assumptions (#229)
- Frontend CI was building with `development` config on `develop`-branch cloud deploys, bundling `localhost:8000` into the deployed app; Private Network Access blocked loopback calls (#224)
- Trailing commas in `CDK_COGNITO_CALLBACK_URLS` / `CDK_COGNITO_LOGOUT_URLS` produced empty strings Cognito rejected with a regex validation error (#222)
- OAuth-paused agent orphaned after resume because the agent cache keyed on the unbuilt prompt but the snapshot persisted the built one; resume landed on a different slot, the paused agent got cache-hit on the next non-resume turn, Strands raised "must resume from interrupt" (#207)
- Cost summary writer raised `decimal.InvalidOperation` when `MessageMetadata.cost` was a breakdown dict instead of a float; rollup silently went stale (#208)
- `reasoningContent` blocks dropped by session persistence broke subsequent Bedrock calls on thinking + tool use turns (required thinking signature field missing) (#203)
- `ensure_session_metadata_exists` GSI gating (#194) regression test: `preview-chat` spec race where mock pollution in the shared vitest worker pool failed with cryptic "undefined" error instead of a clear assertion
- `preview-chat` test flake from module-level `vi.mock('@microsoft/fetch-event-source')` resolved to a different `vi.fn()` instance under the shared worker pool; replaced with a `FETCH_EVENT_SOURCE` `InjectionToken`
- `cost.service.spec` absorbed stray `resource()` loader request by switching to `httpMock.match(...)` (#225)
- Agentcore-identity tests were failing when local `.env` defined `AGENTCORE_RUNTIME_WORKLOAD_NAME`; autouse fixture now scrubs it (#214)
- Session cost/context signals previously preserved stale values across session changes; seed + reset on route change fixes it (#223)
- Compaction state wrote default zeros on first sub-threshold turn of an existing AgentCoreMemory session; lazy-load on `update_after_turn` fixes the silent undercounting (#243)
- `_merge_inference_params` ungated request-side passthrough could let users submit future canonical keys the admin hadn't bounded; now gated against `KNOWN_CANONICAL_PARAMS` (#203)
- Voice WS config-frame injection was a one-shot flag; a SPA sending any non-config text frame first could consume the slot and let subsequent config frames forge identity. Injection now runs on every text-type frame and overwrites `user_id` (#233)
- Cross-origin `HttpClient` requests to app-api now carry the BFF cookie via a new `withCredentialsInterceptor`; previously 160+ calls 401'd after a successful cross-origin login (#221)
- `/auth/callback` same-origin `return_to` splice grafts the scheme + netloc from `BFF_POST_LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL` onto the path so cross-origin dev (`:8000` → `:4200`) lands on the SPA origin (#221)

### 🔒 Security

- BFF `return_to` control-byte bypass closed — `_sanitized_return_to` rejects all C0 control bytes (U+0000..U+001F), not just CR/LF, defeating browser URL-parser strip tricks like `/\t/evil.com` (#221)
- AES-GCM cookie codec now binds the cookie version byte into associated data and stops swallowing KMS infrastructure errors as decode failures (transient KMS hiccups no longer log every active user out) (#213)
- BFF session-cookie tokens validated against `COGNITO_BFF_APP_CLIENT_ID` by a separate validator instance; the SPA validator's client_id check would have rejected every BFF-issued token (#213)
- Pygments 2.19.2 → 2.20.0 (ReDoS in GUID-matching regex, Dependabot alert #71) (#247)
- CodeQL remediation: log-injection on user-controlled `model_id` and other inputs, unused imports/locals across infrastructure, explanatory comments on empty-except blocks (#247)
- Markdown-rendered links remain `rel="noopener noreferrer"` (carried from beta.23)
- Dependabot security alerts resolved: pillow 12.2.0, cryptography 47.0.0, python-multipart 0.0.27, aiohttp 3.13.5, uuid 14.0.0 (#199)

- IAM grants on app-api: Secrets Manager read for BFF client secret + voice ticket signing secret, KMS `GenerateDataKey`/`Decrypt` on the cookie signing key, DynamoDB CRUD on sessions and voice ticket replay tables
- `FrontendStack`: `/config.json` `BucketDeployment` and invalidation removed; `runtimeConfig` object gone; `/auth/cognito/domain-url` SSM lookup removed
