# Release Notes — v1.0.0-beta.22

**Release Date:** April 8, 2026
**Previous Release:** v1.0.0-beta.20 (April 1, 2026)

---

## Highlights

This release replaces the authentication system end-to-end with a **Cognito-native identity broker** and zero-configuration first-boot experience. The previous generic OIDC flow, backend token exchange, and manual auth provider seeding are gone entirely. Alongside the auth migration, **CORS handling is unified** across all six CDK stacks via a shared `buildCorsOrigins` helper, the **RBAC authorization layer is consolidated** to a single `require_app_roles` dependency with role enrichment from stored user profiles, and a **documentation cleanup** purges 54,000+ lines of outdated specs and AI-generated artifacts.

---

## ⚠️ Breaking Change — Cognito Authentication Migration

**This is a breaking change release.** The entire authentication system has been replaced with AWS Cognito as the sole identity broker. The previous generic OIDC implementation — including the backend token exchange service, OIDC discovery endpoint, PKCE flow, and multi-provider auth bootstrapping — has been removed. There is no backward compatibility layer and no migration path that preserves the old auth flow. The legacy implementation is not supported going forward.

**If you are upgrading an existing deployment**, you must:

1. Deploy the Infrastructure stack first to provision the new Cognito User Pool, App Client, and Domain
2. Reconfigure any federated identity providers (e.g., Entra ID, Okta) as Cognito federated IdPs — the old auth provider table format is not compatible
3. Re-bootstrap your admin user via the new first-boot flow (the first user to access the app after upgrade creates the admin account)
4. Update all CI/CD workflows with `CDK_DOMAIN_NAME` and `CDK_CORS_ORIGINS` environment variables

**If you are deploying fresh**, the new first-boot experience handles everything automatically — no manual seeding or Secrets Manager configuration required.

---

## Cognito First-Boot Authentication

The entire authentication architecture has been rearchitected around AWS Cognito as the native identity provider. The previous generic OIDC flow — including manual auth provider seeding, Secrets Manager client secret configuration, and the multi-step bootstrap process — has been removed with no backward compatibility.

### First-Boot Experience

On initial deployment, the first user to access the application is presented with a setup page to create the admin account directly in Cognito. This eliminates the previous multi-step bootstrap process (seed auth provider secrets, configure OIDC endpoints, create initial user). The first-boot flow uses race-condition-safe DynamoDB writes to ensure only one admin account is created.

### Infrastructure

A Cognito User Pool, App Client, and Domain are now provisioned in the Infrastructure CDK stack. SSM parameters wire the Cognito configuration across stacks. The AgentCore Runtime is configured with a single Cognito JWT authorizer, replacing the previous generic OIDC validator.

### Backend

- New `CognitoJWTValidator` replaces `GenericOIDCJWTValidator` with Cognito-specific JWKS validation and claim extraction
- New `system/` module (`cognito_service.py`, `repository.py`, `routes.py`, `models.py`) handles first-boot setup, system status, and Cognito user/group management
- New `cognito_idp_service.py` in `shared/auth_providers/` manages federated identity provider CRUD via Cognito IdP APIs
- `add_user_to_group` method manages Cognito group membership with rollback on failure
- Bootstrap script (`seed_bootstrap_data.py`) simplified — no longer seeds auth provider secrets, focuses on RBAC roles and JWT mappings
- Runtime-provisioner and runtime-updater Lambda functions removed entirely (2,800+ lines deleted)

### Frontend

- New first-boot page (`first-boot.page.ts`) with admin account creation form and `first-boot.guard.ts` route guard
- Login page simplified — delegates to Cognito OAuth 2.0 + PKCE flow instead of managing tokens directly
- `auth-api.service.ts` removed — frontend communicates directly with Cognito
- `callback.service.ts` rewritten for Cognito token exchange
- Auth provider form now displays the required Cognito redirect URI (`{cognitoDomainUrl}/oauth2/idpresponse`) with a copy button for zero-friction IdP registration
- Provider list page simplified — runtime status UI and unused icon imports removed
- Updated favicon and logo assets with refreshed branding and cross-platform icon support

### Test Coverage

1,177 lines of new `CognitoIdPService` tests, 316 lines of `CognitoJWTValidator` tests, 286 lines of first-boot tests, 278 lines of system service tests, plus updated auth route, dependency, RBAC, and auth sweep tests. Frontend gains `SystemService` unit tests and updated auth guard/callback/interceptor specs.

---

## Cognito-Managed Auth Flow Migration

The backend OIDC authentication service and token exchange layer have been removed entirely with no compatibility shim. The frontend now communicates directly with Cognito for all auth operations. The legacy OIDC implementation is not supported and will not be restored.

### Removed

- Backend `auth/models.py`, `auth/service.py`, and associated test files (`test_oidc_auth_service.py`, `test_pkce.py`)
- Token refresh and logout endpoints from backend auth routes
- OIDC discovery endpoint (`POST /discover`) from admin auth provider routes
- 1,318 lines of backend auth code deleted

### Simplified

- Auth routes reduced to a single public provider listing endpoint
- User service updated to work with Cognito-provided user information
- Auth provider repository gains JSON parsing error handling for malformed Secrets Manager values

---

## RBAC Authorization Consolidation

The authorization system has been consolidated from multiple role-checking functions to a single `require_app_roles` dependency that resolves permissions through `AppRoleService`.

### Removed

- `require_roles`, `require_all_roles`, `has_any_role`, `has_all_roles`
- Role-specific decorators: `require_faculty`, `require_staff`, `require_developer`, `require_aws_ai_access`
- Auth module exports simplified to only `require_app_roles` and `require_admin`

### Added

- User roles enriched from stored DynamoDB profile during token processing, ensuring RBAC uses correct IdP-mapped roles instead of Cognito provider group names
- User profile cache invalidation on `sync_my_profile` — subsequent requests pick up fresh roles immediately instead of waiting for the 5-minute cache TTL
- JSON array parsing for `custom:roles` claim (`CognitoJWTValidator`) — supports both `'["Admin","Staff"]'` and comma-separated formats for Entra ID role mapping
- `parseRolesFromToken` utility function on the frontend with 118 lines of test coverage
- `jwt_role_mappings` updates now allowed on `system_admin` role — validation changed from error-raising to silent field filtering with logging
- Role priority maximum increased from 999 to 1000

---

## CORS Unification

All six CDK stacks now use a single shared `buildCorsOrigins()` helper in `config.ts` that builds CORS origins from `CDK_DOMAIN_NAME` (always), `localhost:4200` (always, for local dev), and optional per-section `additionalCorsOrigins`. This replaces the previous per-stack `corsOrigins` fields that were inconsistent and error-prone.

### Changes

- S3 CORS configuration made conditional — `undefined` when no origins are configured, preventing empty CORS rules
- RAG CORS Lambda fix: `ExposedHeaders` corrected to `ExposeHeaders` (the valid boto3 S3 CORS parameter name), fixing CloudFormation custom resource failures during frontend stack deployment
- Both Python APIs (`app_api`, `inference_api`) read `CORS_ORIGINS` env var, replacing hardcoded `allow_origins=['*']` with an env-driven allowlist
- Regression tests added for CORS_ORIGINS in app-api and inference-api stack tests

---

## Bootstrap & Seeding Fixes

- Bootstrap script (`seed_bootstrap_data.py`) is now the sole owner of RBAC role seeding — `ensure_system_roles()` removed from app-api startup to prevent overwriting admin customizations on every boot
- `system_admin` role seeded with `jwt_role_mappings=['system_admin']` instead of empty array — fixes the issue where Cognito first-boot admin users had the right `cognito:groups` claim but no matching AppRole
- Additive JWT mapping seeding: if the role exists but is missing required mappings, they're added without removing existing custom mappings

---

## CI/CD Improvements

- `CDK_DOMAIN_NAME` and `CDK_CORS_ORIGINS` added to all workflow jobs that run synth or deploy (previously missing from `inference-api.yml` and `gateway.yml`, causing `loadConfig` validation failures)
- `CDK_CORS_ORIGINS` and `CDK_FILE_UPLOAD_CORS_ORIGINS` added to nightly deploy pipeline
- SSM `StringParameter` creation guarded with conditional check to prevent empty string values (SSM parameter tier rejects empty strings)
- File upload CORS validation softened from hard error to warning since `loadConfig` runs for all stacks
- Infrastructure workflow updated with Cognito context values
- Trivy image scanning action upgraded from `v0.28.0` to `v0.35.0` with corrected SHA pin — the previous pin (`18f2510`) was actually the `v0.29.0` commit SHA mislabeled as `v0.28.0`, and was among the tags compromised in the [March 2026 trivy-action supply chain attack](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/security/advisories/GHSA-69fq-xp46-6x23). The new pin (`57a97c7e`) points to the post-remediation immutable `v0.35.0` release
- App API `synth-cdk` job now actually skipped on pull requests — the `if: github.event_name != 'pull_request'` guard was missing despite being documented in beta.20. PRs no longer require AWS credentials or ARM runners for the app-api workflow

---

## Bug Fixes

- Model form validation summary now displayed above submit button showing all invalid fields — fixes the greyed-out submit button with no visible errors on edit
- "Add Model" button and "Browse Bedrock/Gemini/OpenAI Models" links uncommented on manage models page
- `SystemService` tests stabilized against shared fetch spy by filtering assertions by URL
- Inference API endpoints updated with `/invocations` path and URL-encoded ARN to prevent parsing errors with AgentCore runtime ARNs
- ALB listener rule updated with `requestHeaderConfiguration` to propagate `Authorization` header to inference API
- AWS Marketplace permissions (`ViewSubscriptions`, `Subscribe`) added to runtime execution role for marketplace-gated Bedrock models

---

## Documentation Cleanup

54,665 lines of outdated AI specs, feature summaries, and documentation purged across 121 files. Removed content includes completed spec directories (agent-core-tests, api-route-tests, auth-rbac-tests, bootstrap-data-seeding, config-cleanup-audit, environment-agnostic-refactor, and 12 others), duplicate docs under `docs/specs/`, the `GEMINI.md` agent config, `codeql-alerts.json` dump, and the `CODE_REVIEW_TOKEN_STORAGE.md` document. The Cognito first-boot auth and reliable document deletion specs were added as replacements.

## Deployment Notes

**This release contains breaking changes.** See the migration steps at the top of this document.

- **Infrastructure:** Deploy first. The stack now provisions a Cognito User Pool, App Client, and Domain. New CDK context values required: `CDK_DOMAIN_NAME` and `CDK_CORS_ORIGINS` must be set in all workflow environments.
- **Backend:** The App API no longer handles token exchange or OIDC discovery. The `GenericOIDCJWTValidator`, `auth/service.py`, `auth/models.py`, and all token management endpoints have been deleted. The `runtime-provisioner` and `runtime-updater` Lambda functions have been removed. Restart all containers.
- **Frontend:** Full rebuild and deploy required. The auth flow now uses Cognito OAuth 2.0 + PKCE directly. The `auth-api.service.ts` has been removed. The first user to access a fresh deployment will see the first-boot setup page.
- **Federated IdPs:** Existing Entra ID, Okta, or other OIDC providers must be reconfigured as Cognito federated identity providers. The old auth provider table format and Secrets Manager secret structure are no longer used. Register the Cognito redirect URI (`{cognitoDomainUrl}/oauth2/idpresponse`) in your external IdP.
- **Bootstrap:** The seed script no longer seeds auth provider secrets or OIDC configuration. It only handles RBAC roles and JWT mappings.
- **Nightly/CI:** All workflows now require `CDK_DOMAIN_NAME` and `CDK_CORS_ORIGINS` environment variables.

# Release Notes — v1.0.0-beta.20

**Release Date:** April 1, 2026
**Previous Release:** v1.0.0-beta.19 (March 25, 2026)

---

## Highlights

This release delivers **reliable document deletion** with a soft-delete lifecycle and background cleanup, a **displayText system** that preserves original user messages when RAG augmentation or file attachments modify the prompt, a **fine-tuning cost dashboard** for admin visibility into SageMaker training spend, and a major **dependency refresh** across all three ecosystems via Dependabot. The security and code quality hardening from the initial beta.20 scope is also included — all CodeQL findings resolved, four Dependabot security vulnerabilities patched, cyclic imports eliminated, and silent exception swallowing replaced with proper logging.

---

## Reliable Document Deletion

Document deletion has been rearchitected with a soft-delete pattern and background cleanup to prevent orphaned S3 objects and vector embeddings.

### Soft-Delete Lifecycle

Documents now transition through a `deleting` status before removal. The delete endpoint marks the document immediately and returns, while cleanup runs asynchronously. A DynamoDB TTL field (7-day expiry) acts as a backstop for failed cleanups.

### Cleanup Service

A new `cleanup_service.py` handles retry logic for S3 vector deletion and source file removal. Deterministic vector key generation ensures reliable cleanup even if the original ingestion metadata is incomplete.

### Search Filtering

The search path now filters out non-complete documents, preventing stale results from appearing when a document is mid-deletion. The RAG service cross-checks document status during search.

### Assistant Deletion

When an assistant is deleted, all associated documents are batch soft-deleted with background cleanup. A new `delete_vectors_for_assistant` function removes embeddings from the vector store by assistant ID.

### Upload Failure Reporting

A new `POST /{document_id}/upload-failed` endpoint allows the frontend to report client-side upload errors, marking documents as failed with error details for debugging.

### Test Coverage

4,200+ lines of new tests across property-based tests (cleanup service, document deletion, search filtering, vector deletion) and integration tests (delete endpoints, cleanup service, document deletion flows).

---

## DisplayText for RAG-Augmented and File Attachment Messages

When RAG augmentation or file attachments modify the user's prompt before sending it to the agent, the original message text is now preserved and displayed in the UI instead of the augmented version.

### How It Works

- The `stream_async` and `StreamCoordinator` accept an `original_message` parameter to capture the user's input before modification
- When the original differs from the augmented version, a `displayText` metadata record (`D#` prefix) is stored in DynamoDB alongside the cost record
- The metadata retrieval path queries both cost records (`C#`) and display text records (`D#`)
- The frontend `user-message` component renders `displayText` when available, falling back to the stored message content

### Debug Output Toggle

A new `showDebugOutput` setting in Chat Preferences lets users toggle visibility of debug information, useful for inspecting what the agent actually received versus what the UI displays.

---

## Fine-Tuning Cost Dashboard

A new admin page provides visibility into SageMaker fine-tuning costs and usage.

### Admin Cost Endpoint

`GET /admin/fine-tuning/costs` returns aggregated cost data for fine-tuning jobs, with per-user breakdowns showing training hours consumed and quota utilization.

### Default Quota Hours

Fine-tuning access control now supports a default monthly quota for users without explicit grants, configurable via `CDK_FINE_TUNING_DEFAULT_QUOTA_HOURS` in the infrastructure config.

### Frontend

A dedicated `/admin/fine-tuning-costs` page displays cost summaries, per-user breakdowns, and usage statistics with period selection.

### Fine-Tuning Dashboard Polish

The fine-tuning dashboard also received an informational section explaining the fine-tuning workflow and updated icons for better visual clarity.

---

## Assistant Simplification

### Archive Removal

The assistant archive functionality has been removed entirely. The `ARCHIVED` status, `archive_assistant` endpoint, and `include_archived` query parameter are gone. Assistants now have a single delete operation — simpler lifecycle, less code.

---

## Conversation Sharing Fixes

### Shared Conversation Deletion

Deleting a session now properly cascades to associated shared conversations. The shares service cleans up all share records when the parent session is deleted, and the frontend session list reflects the deletion state correctly.

### Message Export Fix

The share export feature (`POST /shares/{share_id}/export`) was failing to persist messages to AgentCore Memory. Fixed by switching from the deprecated `append_message` API to `create_message` with proper `SessionMessage` wrapping and index-based ordering.

### UI Improvements

- Shared conversation header simplified — metadata and export button repositioned for cleaner layout
- Export button moved to a floating action bar at the bottom of the shared view
- Icon updates: share icon replaced with `heroAdjustmentsHorizontal` in session management, `heroChatBubbleLeftRight` in shared view header

---

## Testing Infrastructure

### Analog.js Migration

Frontend testing has been migrated to Analog.js tooling (`@analogjs/vite-plugin-angular` and `@analogjs/vitest-angular` v3.0.0-alpha.18). The standalone `vitest.config.ts` has been removed in favor of Analog.js configuration. Analog.js dependencies are pinned to exact versions per the supply chain policy.

### Property-Based Testing

`fast-check` has been added as a dev dependency (v4.6.0, exact pin) for property-based testing in the frontend test suite.

---

## Security Vulnerability Patches

Four Dependabot-flagged vulnerabilities have been patched across all three package ecosystems:

| Package | Version Change | Severity | Issue |
|---------|---------------|----------|-------|
| `requests` (Python) | 2.32.5 → 2.33.0 | Medium | Insecure temp file reuse in `extract_zipped_paths()` |
| `picomatch` (frontend) | 4.0.3 → 4.0.4 | High / Medium | ReDoS via extglob quantifiers; method injection in POSIX character classes |
| `picomatch` (infrastructure) | 2.3.1 → 2.3.2 | Medium | Method injection in POSIX character classes |
| `diff` (infrastructure) | patched | Low | DoS in `parsePatch` / `applyPatch` |

Frontend and infrastructure `picomatch` fixes use npm `overrides` to force patched versions through transitive dependency trees (`@angular-devkit/core`, `@angular/build`).

**Known unfixable:** `yaml@1.10.2` is bundled inside `aws-cdk-lib@2.244.0` (latest) — awaiting an AWS CDK update. `Pygments@2.19.2` (latest) has no patched version yet.

---

## CodeQL Remediation — All Findings Resolved

Two passes resolved every open CodeQL finding on `develop`, covering 130+ files across Python, TypeScript, and GitHub Actions.

### Log Injection (180 fixes)

User-controlled values removed from f-string log statements across the entire backend. All logging now uses `%s`-style parameterized formatting, preventing log injection attacks where user input could forge log entries.

### Silent Exception Swallowing (5 fixes)

Empty `except: pass` blocks — a recurring source of hidden bugs — have been eliminated:

- **`event_formatter.py`** — Errors during final result extraction now log a warning instead of vanishing silently. This was masking streaming failures that were impossible to diagnose.
- **`url_fetcher.py`** — Bare `except:` (catching `BaseException` including `KeyboardInterrupt`) narrowed to `Exception` with an explanatory comment.
- **`code_interpreter_diagram_tool.py`** — Same bare `except:` fix as above.
- **`admin/users/service.py`** — Invalid pagination cursors now log a warning instead of silently resetting to page 1.
- **`tool_result_processor.py`** — `JSONDecodeError` catch annotated with intent comment.

### Cyclic Import Eliminated

The circular dependency between `metadata_storage.py` and `dynamodb_storage.py` has been broken by moving the `get_metadata_storage()` factory function to the package `__init__.py`. The dependency graph is now one-directional:

```
storage/__init__.py (factory) → dynamodb_storage.py → metadata_storage.py (ABC)
```

Three callers updated to import from `apis.app_api.storage` instead of `apis.app_api.storage.metadata_storage`.

### Other Fixes

- **Unreachable code** — Dead `if result_seen: break` removed from `stream_processor.py` (`result_seen` was initialized to `False` and never set to `True`)
- **Redundant assignment** — Unused `job =` on `create_inference_job()` call removed in fine-tuning routes
- **Print during import** — `print()` statements in `inference_api/main.py` replaced with `logging`
- **Commented-out code** — Stale `InvocationRequest` class removed from inference API models
- **Unnecessary lambdas** — `lambda v: int(v)` simplified to `int` in fine-tuning repositories
- **13 unused local variables** removed across 10 files
- **3 unused imports** removed (including dead re-exports in `bedrock_embeddings.py`)

### False Positives Dismissed (11 alerts)

- 9× `actions/untrusted-checkout` on nightly workflows — these are schedule/dispatch only, never triggered by PRs
- 1× `py/non-iterable-in-for-loop` — iterating over `Enum` members is valid Python
- 1× `py/unused-global-variable` — `_generic_validator_initialized` is used via `global` statement (CodeQL doesn't track this)

---

## RAG Ingestion Fixes

### Lambda Image Digest Refresh

Fixed an issue where RAG ingestion Lambda deployments would report "no changes" even after pushing a fresh Docker image. The root cause: CDK resolves the image tag via SSM at synth time, and if the tag hasn't changed (only the underlying layers), CloudFormation sees no diff. The deploy script now explicitly calls `update-function-code` after image push to force a digest refresh, with a wait condition to ensure the update completes.

### Shared Embeddings Module

Added the shared embeddings package to the RAG ingestion Lambda Docker image, resolving import errors when `bedrock_embeddings.py` attempted to load re-exported functions from `apis.shared.embeddings`.

---

## CI/CD Improvements

### PR Workflow Optimization

CDK synthesis (`synth-cdk`) is now skipped on pull requests in the app-api workflow, matching the existing pattern for Docker builds and deployments. PRs no longer require AWS credentials for the synth step.

### GitHub Actions Updates

- `actions/upload-artifact` upgraded from 6.0.0 to 7.0.0
- `actions/download-artifact` upgraded from 7.0.0 to 8.0.1
- `actions/setup-node` upgraded from 5.0.0 to 6.3.0
- `github/codeql-action` upgraded to latest SHA

## Test Fixes

- Removed stale `AgentCoreMemorySessionManager` mock patch from session factory tests — the previous CodeQL commit correctly removed the unused import, but the test was still patching it at the old module path
- Updated shared view page spec with expanded test coverage (254 lines rewritten)
- Updated share export tests to match the new `create_message` API

---

## Deployment Notes

This release includes new backend endpoints and frontend pages but no new infrastructure resources (no new DynamoDB tables or S3 buckets). All changes are backward-compatible.

- **Backend:** Restart App API and Inference API containers to pick up document deletion, displayText, cost dashboard, and dependency upgrades
- **Frontend:** Rebuild and deploy to pick up Analog.js testing migration, displayText rendering, cost dashboard page, and `picomatch` security patch
- **Infrastructure:** Run `npm install` to pick up `picomatch` and `diff` patches in lockfile. Redeploy if using fine-tuning to pick up the default quota hours config.
- **RAG Ingestion:** Redeploy to pick up the Lambda image digest fix and shared embeddings module

---

# Release Notes — v1.0.0-beta.19

**Release Date:** March 25, 2026
**Previous Release:** v1.0.0-beta.18 (March 24, 2026)

---

## Highlights

This release introduces **Conversation Sharing** — a full-stack feature that lets users share point-in-time snapshots of conversations via URL, with public or email-restricted access controls. Alongside that, **session compaction** has been refactored and enabled by default to automatically manage context window size in long conversations, **fine-tuning** gains drag-and-drop dataset uploads and custom HuggingFace model support, and a round of **security hardening** resolves all remaining CodeQL clear-text logging alerts. The frontend production build is now fully optimized (4.96 MB initial, down from 8.85 MB), and PR workflows have been slimmed down to only run build and test steps.

---

## New Feature: Conversation Sharing

Users can now share conversations with others via shareable URLs. Shares are point-in-time snapshots — the shared view captures the conversation as it existed at the moment of sharing, so subsequent messages don't leak into shared links.

### How It Works

- **Share modal** accessible from the session UI lets users create a share with either `public` (anyone with the link) or `specific` (restricted to a list of email addresses) access
- **Manage shares dialog** on the session management page shows all active shares with options to update access levels or revoke
- **Read-only shared view** at `/shared/:shareId` renders the conversation with full markdown formatting, no authentication required for public shares
- **Export support** for downloading shared conversations

### Backend

Three new API routers handle the sharing lifecycle:

- `POST /conversations/{session_id}/share` — Create a share snapshot
- `GET /conversations/{session_id}/shares` — List shares for a session
- `PUT /shares/{share_id}` — Update access level or allowed emails
- `DELETE /shares/{share_id}` — Revoke a share
- `GET /shares/{share_id}/export` — Export shared conversation
- `GET /shared/{share_id}` — Public read-only retrieval

### Infrastructure

A new `shared-conversations` DynamoDB table is provisioned in the Infrastructure stack with two GSIs:

- `SessionShareIndex` — Lookup shares by original session ID
- `OwnerShareIndex` — List shares by owner, sorted by creation time

The table name and ARN are exported via SSM parameters and imported by the App API stack, which grants full CRUD permissions to the Fargate task role.

### Test Coverage

1,300+ lines of new tests across three test files covering share CRUD operations, access control enforcement, export functionality, and property validation.

---

## Session Compaction — Enabled by Default

The session compaction system has been refactored and is now **enabled by default** for all conversations. Compaction automatically manages context window size by summarizing older turns when the token count exceeds the threshold, keeping conversations responsive without manual intervention.

- **Default configuration:** enabled, 100K token threshold, 3 protected recent turns, 500-char max tool content length
- **Turn-based session manager** rewritten with cleaner separation of concerns (870-line net reduction)
- **Expanded test suite** with 481+ new lines of test coverage for compaction behavior

---

## Fine-Tuning Enhancements

### Drag-and-Drop Dataset Upload

The training job creation page now supports drag-and-drop file upload with visual feedback, replacing the basic file picker. Upload instructions have been updated to guide users through dataset formatting requirements.

### Custom HuggingFace Model Support

Users are no longer limited to the preset model list. The training job form now includes a searchable model selector that accepts any valid HuggingFace model identifier. The backend validates and passes custom model IDs through to SageMaker. Frontend tests cover the custom model selection and submission flow.

---

## Security Hardening

### Clear-Text Logging Remediation

All remaining CodeQL clear-text logging alerts have been resolved:

- **`seed_auth_provider`** — Client IDs masked to first 8 characters, Secrets Manager ARNs fully redacted from output
- **`seed_bootstrap_data`** — Full exception objects replaced with error codes in log messages
- **`external_mcp_client`** — Server URLs removed from logs, MCP client configuration logging downgraded from info to debug
- **`oauth_tool_service`** — Decrypted tokens isolated into `_try_get_token()` to prevent taint propagation, lazy log formatting applied
- **`config.ts`** — AWS account IDs and CORS origins removed from CDK config log output

### OAuth Redirect Validation

The OAuth callback endpoint now validates redirect URLs to prevent open redirect vulnerabilities.

### Workflow Permissions

All 13 GitHub Actions workflows now declare explicit `permissions: contents: read`, implementing the principle of least privilege instead of relying on default token permissions.

---

## Frontend Production Optimization

The Angular production build is now fully optimized:

- Removed `optimization: false` override from base build options that was blocking the production configuration
- Production config now enables full optimization, disables source maps, and extracts licenses
- `anyComponentStyle` budget increased from 4 kB to 200 kB to accommodate Tailwind CSS
- **Result:** 4.96 MB initial bundle (871 KB gzipped), down from 8.85 MB unoptimized
- `BUILD_CONFIG` is now branch-aware: `main` → production, `develop` → development, manual dispatch → user input

### Google Fonts Fix

Google Fonts `@import` statements moved from component CSS to `index.html` `<link>` tags, fixing a CI build failure where the CSS optimizer couldn't resolve external font URLs.

---

## CI/CD Improvements

### Lighter PR Workflows

Pull request workflow runs have been significantly trimmed across all 7 deployment workflows. PRs now only run:

- Dependency installation and caching
- Stack dependency validation
- CDK TypeScript compilation (catches build errors)
- Python tests (app-api, inference-api)
- Frontend tests (Vitest)

Skipped on PRs: Docker image builds, Docker image tests, CDK synthesis, CDK validation, ECR push, and deployment. This reduces PR CI time and eliminates the need for AWS credentials on pull requests.

---

## Bug Fixes

- **Bedrock prompt caching** — Caching configuration commented out in model config due to current Bedrock limitations. Tests updated to reflect the change.

---

## Deployment Notes

This release adds a new DynamoDB table (`shared-conversations`) to the Infrastructure stack. Deploy the Infrastructure stack first, then the App API stack. If deploying all stacks simultaneously, the App API deployment may fail on first run due to the SSM parameter dependency — just rerun it after Infrastructure completes.

---
# Release Notes — v1.0.0-beta.18

**Release Date:** March 24, 2026
**Previous Release:** v1.0.0-beta.17 (March 23, 2026)

---

## Highlights

This release is a **supply chain security hardening** release. Every dependency across all three ecosystems (Python, npm, GitHub Actions) has been pinned to exact versions, all GitHub Actions are SHA-pinned, CI runners are locked to `ubuntu-24.04`, Dockerfile `apt`/`dnf` packages are version-pinned, and a new 11-file property-based test suite enforces these invariants going forward. Alongside the hardening, the release adds **CodeQL Advanced security scanning**, a **flexible nightly track system** that replaces the monolithic nightly pipeline, and migrates **RAG resources out of the App API stack** into the dedicated RAG Ingestion stack.

---

## ⚠️ Deployment Note — RAG Data Loss on Existing Deployments

This release removes the assistants documents S3 bucket (`assistants-documents`), S3 Vector Bucket (`assistants-vector-store-v1`), and Vector Index (`assistants-vector-index-v1`) from `AppApiStack`. These resources are now created in `RagIngestionStack` under new names (`rag-vector-store-v1`, etc.). Because CloudFormation tracks resources by logical ID within a stack, deploying this release will cause CDK to delete the old resources from the App API stack. Any existing assistant documents and vector embeddings stored in those buckets will be lost.

If your deployment has data in these resources, you should manually back up or migrate the contents before deploying. If `CDK_RETAIN_DATA_ON_DELETE` is `true` in your environment, the removal policy may be set to `RETAIN`, which would orphan the resources instead of deleting them — but you should verify this against your configuration before relying on it.

---

## Supply Chain Security Hardening

A comprehensive security audit identified 17 findings across GitHub Actions, dependency manifests, Dockerfiles, and install scripts. This release addresses all of them.

### GitHub Actions SHA Pinning

All third-party GitHub Actions are now pinned to specific commit SHAs with version comments (e.g., `actions/checkout@de0fac2e...  # v6.0.2`). This prevents tag-rewriting supply chain attacks where a compromised action could inject malicious code into CI runs.

### Runner Pinning

All workflow jobs now use `ubuntu-24.04` instead of `ubuntu-latest`, ensuring consistent and reproducible build environments that won't silently change behavior when GitHub rolls forward the `latest` tag.

### Exact Dependency Pinning

All three ecosystems have been migrated from range specifiers (`>=`, `^`, `~`) to exact version pins:

- **Python** (`pyproject.toml`): Every dependency uses `==` pins (e.g., `fastapi==0.135.2`, `boto3==1.42.73`, `strands-agents==1.32.0`)
- **npm frontend** (`package.json`): All `^` prefixes removed, exact versions throughout (e.g., `@angular/core` `21.2.5`, `tailwindcss` `4.2.1`)
- **npm infrastructure** (`package.json`): Same treatment (e.g., `aws-cdk-lib` `2.244.0`, `aws-cdk` `2.1113.0`)

### Dockerfile Package Pinning

All `apt-get install` and `dnf install` commands now specify exact package versions:

- App API and Inference API Dockerfiles: `gcc=4:14.2.0-1`, `g++=4:14.2.0-1`, `curl=8.14.1-2+deb13u2`
- RAG Ingestion Dockerfile: All 9 `dnf` packages pinned (gcc, make, mesa-libGL, glib2, tar, gzip, ca-certificates, unzip)

### Script Hardening

All deployment and install scripts now use `npm ci` exclusively (no `npm install` fallback), ensuring lockfile-driven deterministic installs across all environments.

### Artifact Retention Policy

A new `.github/ARTIFACT_RETENTION.md` defines tiered retention periods: Docker tarballs and CDK build artifacts at 1 day, synthesized templates and test results at 7 days, deployment outputs and Trivy scan reports at 30 days. All workflow `retention-days` values have been aligned to this policy.

### Supply Chain Test Suite

A new `backend/tests/supply_chain/` directory contains 11 property-based test files that validate security invariants:

- Action SHA pinning, runner version pinning, dependency exact pinning
- Dockerfile package pinning, artifact retention consistency
- Concurrency configuration, secret scoping, script hardening
- Dependabot configuration, documentation presence

These tests run as part of the standard `pytest` suite and will catch regressions if anyone reintroduces range specifiers or unpinned actions.

---

## CodeQL Advanced Security Scanning

A new `codeql.yml` workflow provides static analysis across three languages: Python, TypeScript, and GitHub Actions. It uses the `security-and-quality` query suite for broad vulnerability and code quality coverage, plus the `github-actions` threat model for full Actions taint tracking (18 queries covering code injection, artifact poisoning, cache poisoning, and secret exposure).

The workflow runs on push and PR to `develop`, plus a weekly scheduled scan to catch new CVEs even when code hasn't changed. A custom `codeql-config.yml` excludes vendored, generated, test, and build artifact paths to keep scan times reasonable. The first scan already surfaced unused imports and variables in the supply chain test suite, which have been cleaned up in this release.

---

## Flexible Nightly Track Selection

The monolithic nightly pipeline has been replaced with a composable track-based system. Instead of a single `NIGHTLY_ENABLED` boolean, the workflow now reads a `NIGHTLY_TRACKS` variable (or `workflow_dispatch` input) containing comma-separated track tokens:

- `test-backend-<branch>` / `test-frontend-<branch>` — Run tests against any branch
- `deploy-<branch>` — Deploy full stack from any branch
- `merge-validation:<base>:<overlay>` — Deploy base, then overlay (simulates merge)
- `scan-images-<branch>` — Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities
- `all` — Run everything with default branches

A new `resolve-tracks` job parses the tokens into boolean flags and branch refs consumed by downstream jobs. The deploy pipeline is extracted into a reusable `nightly-deploy-pipeline.yml` called up to 3 times (deploy track, MV base, MV overlay), eliminating all duplication. Fork safety is preserved — if `NIGHTLY_TRACKS` is empty, nothing runs.

---

## RAG Resources Migration

RAG resources (assistants documents bucket, S3 Vector Bucket, Vector Index) have been removed from `AppApiStack` and are now exclusively managed by `RagIngestionStack`. The App API stack imports these resources via SSM parameters, improving separation of concerns and eliminating cross-stack resource ownership issues.

The vector store IAM permissions in the App API task role now reference the RAG vector bucket imported from SSM (`/${projectPrefix}/rag/vector-bucket-name`) instead of a locally-created bucket, with a named SID (`RagVectorStoreAccess`) for better auditability.

---

## Embeddings Refactor

Core embedding and vector store operations have been extracted from the ingestion pipeline into a new shared module at `apis.shared.embeddings`. The functions `generate_embeddings`, `store_embeddings_in_s3`, `search_assistant_knowledgebase`, and `delete_vectors_for_document` now live in `apis.shared.embeddings.bedrock_embeddings`, with the ingestion-specific module re-exporting them for backward compatibility.

A new `skip_token_validation` parameter on `generate_embeddings` allows callers to bypass tiktoken-based token validation for short inputs in environments where tiktoken is unavailable (e.g., search Lambda functions). The ingestion pipeline retains its own token validation and chunk-splitting logic.

---

## Dependabot Configuration

A new `.github/dependabot.yml` monitors all four ecosystems (pip, frontend npm, infrastructure npm, GitHub Actions) on a weekly Monday 9 AM Mountain Time schedule. Minor and patch updates are grouped to reduce PR noise (Angular updates grouped separately from other frontend deps, AWS CDK grouped separately from other infrastructure deps). All PRs target the `develop` branch with ecosystem-specific labels.

---

## CI/CD Improvements

- **AWS credentials action upgraded** to `v6.0.0` with SHA pinning, plus a new sanitization step that replaces illegal characters in OIDC role session names and truncates to the 64-character AWS limit
- **Explicit OIDC permissions** added to nightly deploy, MV base, and MV overlay jobs (`id-token: write`, `contents: read`)
- **SageMaker conditional gating** — synth job now outputs an `enabled` flag based on `CDK_FINE_TUNING_ENABLED`; test and deploy jobs skip when fine-tuning is disabled
- **Node.js 24 action warnings** fixed after SHA-pinning reintroduced older action references

# Release Notes — v1.0.0-beta.17

**Release Date:** March 23, 2026
**Previous Release:** v1.0.0-beta.16 (March 20, 2026)

---

## Highlights

This release delivers three major improvements: a **centralized Settings experience** that consolidates scattered user preferences into dedicated pages backed by a new DynamoDB table, a **pip-to-uv migration** that modernizes the entire Python build pipeline with hardened Docker images, and **runtime environment refresh** so AgentCore containers always pick up the latest SSM parameter values on every deploy instead of carrying forward stale configuration.

---

## Centralized User Settings

The user dropdown menu has been slimmed down to just email, admin link, settings, and logout. All user-facing features that were previously scattered across the dropdown and standalone pages have been consolidated into a `/settings/*` route hierarchy with dedicated pages:

- **Profile** — Read-only user info display with a link to My Files
- **Appearance** — Theme chooser (persisted to localStorage) with placeholders for density and font size
- **Chat Preferences** — Default model selector backed by a new User Settings API (`GET/PUT /users/me/settings`), show-token-count toggle, and links to Manage Conversations and Memories
- **Connections** — Full OAuth connect/disconnect flow via a new `ConnectionsService`
- **API Keys** — Migrated from the standalone `/api-keys` page with loading states
- **Usage** — Migrated from the standalone `/costs` dashboard with a month picker for historical data

### Backend

A new `user-settings` DynamoDB table and repository store per-user preferences (starting with `defaultModelId`). The table is provisioned in the Infrastructure stack with IAM permissions granted to both the App API Fargate tasks and Inference API runtime roles. Graceful degradation is built in — if the table doesn't exist yet, the API returns defaults without errors.

### Removed

The standalone Notifications and Privacy settings pages were removed as unnecessary.

---

## pip → uv Migration

The entire Python toolchain has been migrated from pip to [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), affecting Docker builds, CI pipelines, and local development workflows.

### Docker Security Hardening

- All base images pinned to `@sha256` digests (Python 3.13-slim, Lambda Python 3.12)
- Non-root `USER` directive added to the App API Dockerfile
- Rust toolchain installed via `COPY --from=rust:1.87-slim` (pinned digest) instead of `curl | sh`
- Torch pinned to exact version (`2.10.0`) in RAG ingestion with `--require-hashes` install from a generated `requirements.lock`
- `curl` removed from builder stages

### CI/CD

- All three Dockerfiles (app-api, inference-api, rag-ingestion) rewritten for uv
- CI install and test scripts updated for both app-api and inference-api
- Workflow caching switched to uv cache paths
- `backend/uv.lock` added to workflow path triggers
- `sync-version.sh` now handles `uv.lock` regeneration with PEP 440 version conversion

### New Release Workflow

A standalone `release.yml` workflow triggers on push to main, creating annotated git tags and GitHub Releases from `RELEASE_NOTES.md`. Pre-release versions (alpha/beta/rc/dev) are automatically detected and flagged.

### Dependabot

A new `.github/dependabot.yml` monitors pip, npm, and GitHub Actions dependencies.

---

## Runtime Provisioner: SSM Environment Refresh

Previously, when an AgentCore runtime was updated (e.g., on redeploy), the provisioner Lambda preserved the existing environment variables from the original runtime creation. This meant renamed tables, new SSM parameters, or changed values were never picked up.

Now, `update_runtime()` re-fetches all environment variables from SSM on every update. A fallback to existing values is included if the SSM refresh fails, maintaining stability. The runtime-updater Lambda also gained a `get_fresh_environment_variables()` function for consistent handling.

---

## Configurable Memory Retrieval Thresholds

AgentCore Memory retrieval is now tunable via two new environment variables:

- `AGENTCORE_MEMORY_RELEVANCE_SCORE` — Minimum relevance score for retrieved memories (default raised from 0.3–0.5 to 0.7)
- `AGENTCORE_MEMORY_TOP_K` — Maximum number of memories to retrieve

All memory-related environment variables have been renamed from `COMPACTION_*` to `AGENTCORE_MEMORY_COMPACTION_*` for consistent naming.

---

## Assistant UX Improvements

The assistant experience in the chat interface received several polish updates:

- **Action dropdown** on the assistant indicator with options to start a new session, edit the assistant, or share it
- **Share dialog** on the assistant form page for sharing assistants with other users
- **Skeleton loading indicators** replace blank states while the assistant and chat input are loading
- **Improved greeting visibility** — the assistant greeting now shows/hides properly based on loading state
- **Sidenav updates** — the new session button and assistant navigation link are now accessible from the sidebar
- **Responsive card layout** fix for the assistant list page

---

## SageMaker Fine-Tuning Fixes

- **Job name scoping** — Training and transform job names are now prefixed with `PROJECT_PREFIX` to match the IAM policy's `${projectPrefix}-*` resource constraint. Previously, jobs used `ft-` and `inf-` prefixes which caused `AccessDeniedException` on `CreateTrainingJob`.
- **Missing IAM actions** — Added `sagemaker:CreateModel` and `sagemaker:DeleteModel` actions plus the model resource ARN to the IAM policy for transform job support.
- **Log access** — Added `logs:DescribeLogStreams` to the IAM policy so the fine-tuning dashboard can display SageMaker training logs.
- **CDK toggle** — Added `CDK_FINE_TUNING_ENABLED` environment variable to the app-api CI workflow for conditional stack deployment.

---

## Bug Fixes

- **User settings API trailing slashes** — Removed trailing slashes from the `/users/me/settings` routes that caused 307 redirects on some HTTP clients.
- **Assistant list card layout** — Fixed responsive grid breakpoints on the assistant list page so cards don't overflow on narrow viewports.

---

## Documentation & Developer Experience

- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with revised coding standards, testing guidelines, and file creation rules
- README logo and header formatting refreshed for better visibility and alignment

# Release Notes — v1.0.0-beta.16

**Release Date:** March 20, 2026
**Previous Release:** v1.0.0-beta.15 (March 20, 2026)

---

## Hotfix: Runtime Provisioner SSM Path

The runtime provisioner Lambda was still referencing the old `/file-upload/table-name` SSM parameter path for the user files DynamoDB table. This caused `AccessDeniedException` on `dynamodb:GetItem` because the AgentCore runtime container received the old table name (`user-files`) while the IAM policy was scoped to the new table (`user-file-uploads`). Updated to `/user-file-uploads/table-name` to match the Infrastructure stack's SSM exports.

---

---

# Release Notes — v1.0.0-beta.15

**Release Date:** March 20, 2026
**Previous Release:** v1.0.0-beta.8 (March 16, 2026)

---

## Highlights

This release introduces the **SageMaker Fine-Tuning** stack — a complete model training and inference platform built on Amazon SageMaker, deployable as an optional CDK stack. Beyond that, the release delivers **security hardening**, **deployment reliability**, and **platform modernization**: RBAC model access enforcement is now applied at the inference layer, the nightly CI/CD pipeline gains a full merge-validation track to catch integration issues before release, and the entire stack has been upgraded to current runtime versions (Python 3.13, Angular 21.2, Node.js 24 Actions, CDK 2.1112).

---

## ⚠️ Deployment Note

Merging this release will trigger all stack workflows simultaneously. File upload resources (S3 bucket, DynamoDB table, SSM parameters) were moved into the Infrastructure stack, so the App API and Inference API deployments may fail if Infrastructure hasn't finished yet. This is expected — just rerun the failed workflows after the Infrastructure deployment completes.

---

## New Feature: SageMaker Fine-Tuning

A complete model fine-tuning platform has been added, allowing users with admin-granted access to train and run inference on open-source models directly from the UI.

- New `SageMakerFineTuningStack` CDK stack with DynamoDB tables, S3 storage, and IAM roles for SageMaker training/inference
- Backend API with full CRUD for training jobs, inference jobs, and admin access management (`/fine-tuning/` routes)
- SageMaker integration for launching training jobs on models like BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2 with configurable hyperparameters (epochs, batch size, learning rate, train/test split)
- Batch inference support on trained models with real-time progress tracking
- Frontend dashboard with job creation wizards, detail pages, status badges, quota cards, and dataset upload via presigned S3 URLs
- Admin access control page for granting/revoking fine-tuning permissions per user
- Automatic 30-day artifact retention with lifecycle policies
- Dedicated CI/CD workflow (`sagemaker-fine-tuning.yml`) with build, synth, test, and deploy scripts
- EC2 networking permissions for VPC-based training jobs
- Elapsed time display and polling for active jobs
- Comprehensive test suite (admin routes, user routes, repositories, SageMaker service, training/inference scripts)

---

## Community Contribution 🎉

This release includes our first outside contribution! Thanks to [@magicfoodhand](https://github.com/magicfoodhand) for **Session List Grouping Enhancements** (#43) — the session sidebar now groups conversations by date range (Today, Yesterday, Previous 7 Days, etc.) and supports inline session renaming. A great UX improvement.

---

## Bug Fixes

- **RBAC model access not enforced on Inference API** (#31, #47) — Role-based model access was only checked on the App API side, allowing the Inference API's Converse and Invocations endpoints to bypass model-level RBAC. Both endpoints now call `can_access_model()` and reject unauthorized requests with HTTP 403 before any Bedrock invocation occurs. Includes 1,500+ lines of new test coverage.
- **Deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` replaced** — All backend modules (quota recorder, admin models, user service, file service, tools, document ingestion) now use timezone-aware `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`, resolving Python 3.12+ deprecation warnings.
- **Cross-stack SSM deployment failure properly fixed** — File upload resources (S3 bucket, DynamoDB table, SSM parameters) have been relocated from `AppApiStack` to `InfrastructureStack`, eliminating the cross-stack dependency that caused first-time deployment failures. The beta.8 hotfix (hardcoded ARN construction) was a temporary workaround; this is the permanent solution.
- **Dependency conflict resolved** — Pillow was temporarily removed then restored alongside numpy to resolve a packaging conflict with `strands-agents-tools`.

---

## Infrastructure & Configuration

### File Upload Resources Relocated to Infrastructure Stack
File upload S3 bucket and DynamoDB table have been moved from `AppApiStack` to `InfrastructureStack` to eliminate the cross-stack dependency between Inference API (tier 2) and App API (tier 3). Unfortunately, the path of least resistance was to recreate these resources with new names, so be aware that some data loss may occur when updating an existing deployment. SSM parameter paths have been renamed from `/file-upload/` to `/user-file-uploads/` for consistency. 

### Auto-Derived CORS Origins
Deployments no longer require explicit `CDK_CORS_ORIGINS`. If only `CDK_DOMAIN_NAME` is set, CORS origins are automatically derived as `https://<domain>`. This simplifies initial setup and reduces configuration errors.

### Unified Removal Policies
S3 buckets and Secrets Manager secrets across all stacks (`AppApiStack`, `InfrastructureStack`, `RagIngestionStack`) now use config-driven removal policies via `getRemovalPolicy(config)` and `getAutoDeleteObjects(config)` instead of hardcoded `RETAIN`. This enables clean teardown in non-production environments.

### AWS Account in Resource Naming
`getResourceName()` calls for S3 buckets now include `config.awsAccount`, ensuring unique and consistent resource names across multi-account deployments. Be aware of potential data loss when updating existing deployments as the default bucket naming scheme has changed. Each stack will now suffix the account number to prevent s3 name collisions.

## CI/CD & DevOps

### Nightly Pipeline Improvements
A new merge-validation track deploys `main` branch infrastructure first, then deploys `develop` branch on top — simulating the real merge scenario. This catches integration issues between branches before they reach production. The track includes full stack deployment (infrastructure → RAG ingestion → inference API → app API → frontend) with automatic teardown. Nightlies also no longer rebuild Docker images; a new `promote-ecr-image.sh` script copies pre-built images from the develop ECR repository to the target environment, cutting pipeline time and ensuring image parity with what was tested on develop.

### Stack Dependency Validation
All GitHub workflows now include a `check-stack-dependencies` gate job that validates CDK stack dependencies before any build or deploy step runs. A new `test-stack-dependencies.sh` script powers this check.

### GitHub Actions Node.js 24 Migration
All GitHub Actions have been upgraded to Node.js 24-compatible versions:
- `actions/checkout` v4 → v5
- `actions/cache` v4 → v5
- `actions/upload-artifact` / `download-artifact` v4 → v5 (then v7)
- `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` v4 → v6
- `docker/setup-buildx-action` v3 → v4
- `docker/build-push-action` v6 → v7

### Additional CI Improvements
- Fork guard prevents accidental nightly runs on forked repositories
- Package-lock.json sync validation added to version-check workflow
- Frontend build caching with split build/deploy steps (nightly)
- Centralized pipeline summary table
- Artifact handling switched from cache to upload/download actions
- Retry logic added to smoke test health checks
- S3 Vector Bucket cleanup added to teardown scripts (nightly)
- CloudWatch log group cleanup added to teardown scripts (nightly)
- Reduced CI log verbosity across all workflows
