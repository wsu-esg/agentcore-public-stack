# Release Notes — v1.0.0-beta.15

**Release Date:** March 20, 2026
**Previous Release:** v1.0.0-beta.8 (March 16, 2026)

---

## Highlights

This release focuses on **security hardening**, **deployment reliability**, and **platform modernization**. RBAC model access enforcement is now applied at the inference layer, the nightly CI/CD pipeline gains a full merge-validation track to catch integration issues before release, and the entire stack has been upgraded to current runtime versions (Python 3.13, Angular 21.2, Node.js 24 Actions, CDK 2.1112).

---

## ⚠️ Deployment Note

Merging this release will trigger all stack workflows simultaneously. File upload resources (S3 bucket, DynamoDB table, SSM parameters) were moved into the Infrastructure stack, so the App API and Inference API deployments may fail if Infrastructure hasn't finished yet. This is expected — just rerun the failed workflows after the Infrastructure deployment completes.

## New Feature: SageMaker Fine-Tuning

A complete model fine-tuning platform has been added, allowing users with admin-granted access to train and run inference on open-source models directly from the UI.

- New `SageMakerFineTuningStack` CDK stack with DynamoDB tables, S3 storage, and IAM roles for SageMaker training/inference
- Backend API with full CRUD for training jobs, inference jobs, and admin access management (`/fine-tuning/` routes)
- SageMaker integration for launching training jobs on models like BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2 with configurable hyperparameters (epochs, batch size, learning rate, train/test split)
- Batch inference support on trained models with real-time progress tracking
- Frontend dashboard with job creation wizards, detail pages, status badges, quota cards, and dataset upload via presigned S3 URLs
- Admin access control page for granting/revoking fine-tuning permissions per user
- Automatic 30-day artifact retention with lifecycle policies
- Dedicated CI/CD workflow (`sagemaker-fine-tuning.yml`) with build, synth, test, and deploy scripts
- EC2 networking permissions for VPC-based training jobs
- Elapsed time display and polling for active jobs
- Comprehensive test suite (admin routes, user routes, repositories, SageMaker service, training/inference scripts)

## Bug Fixes

- **RBAC model access not enforced on Inference API** (#31, #47) — Role-based model access was only checked on the App API side, allowing the Inference API's Converse and Invocations endpoints to bypass model-level RBAC. Both endpoints now call `can_access_model()` and reject unauthorized requests with HTTP 403 before any Bedrock invocation occurs. Includes 1,500+ lines of new test coverage.
- **Deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` replaced** — All backend modules (quota recorder, admin models, user service, file service, tools, document ingestion) now use timezone-aware `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`, resolving Python 3.12+ deprecation warnings.
- **Cross-stack SSM deployment failure properly fixed** — File upload resources (S3 bucket, DynamoDB table, SSM parameters) have been relocated from `AppApiStack` to `InfrastructureStack`, eliminating the cross-stack dependency that caused first-time deployment failures. The beta.8 hotfix (hardcoded ARN construction) was a temporary workaround; this is the permanent solution.
- **Dependency conflict resolved** — Pillow was temporarily removed then restored alongside numpy to resolve a packaging conflict with `strands-agents-tools`.

## Infrastructure & Configuration

### File Upload Resources Relocated to Infrastructure Stack
File upload S3 bucket and DynamoDB table have been moved from `AppApiStack` to `InfrastructureStack` to eliminate the cross-stack dependency between Inference API (tier 2) and App API (tier 3). Unfortunately, the path of least resistance was to recreate these resources with new names, so be aware that some data loss may occur when updating an existing deployment. SSM parameter paths have been renamed from `/file-upload/` to `/user-file-uploads/` for consistency. 

### Auto-Derived CORS Origins
Deployments no longer require explicit `CDK_CORS_ORIGINS`. If only `CDK_DOMAIN_NAME` is set, CORS origins are automatically derived as `https://<domain>`. This simplifies initial setup and reduces configuration errors.

### Unified Removal Policies
S3 buckets and Secrets Manager secrets across all stacks (`AppApiStack`, `InfrastructureStack`, `RagIngestionStack`) now use config-driven removal policies via `getRemovalPolicy(config)` and `getAutoDeleteObjects(config)` instead of hardcoded `RETAIN`. This enables clean teardown in non-production environments.

### AWS Account in Resource Naming
`getResourceName()` calls for S3 buckets now include `config.awsAccount`, ensuring unique and consistent resource names across multi-account deployments. Be aware of potential data loss when updating existing deployments as the default bucket naming scheme has changed. Each stack will now suffix the account number to prevent s3 name collisions.

## CI/CD & DevOps

### Nightly Pipeline Improvements
A new merge-validation track deploys `main` branch infrastructure first, then deploys `develop` branch on top — simulating the real merge scenario. This catches integration issues between branches before they reach production. The track includes full stack deployment (infrastructure → RAG ingestion → inference API → app API → frontend) with automatic teardown. Nightlies also no longer rebuild Docker images; a new `promote-ecr-image.sh` script copies pre-built images from the develop ECR repository to the target environment, cutting pipeline time and ensuring image parity with what was tested on develop.

### Stack Dependency Validation
All GitHub workflows now include a `check-stack-dependencies` gate job that validates CDK stack dependencies before any build or deploy step runs. A new `test-stack-dependencies.sh` script powers this check.

### GitHub Actions Node.js 24 Migration
All GitHub Actions have been upgraded to Node.js 24-compatible versions:
- `actions/checkout` v4 → v5
- `actions/cache` v4 → v5
- `actions/upload-artifact` / `download-artifact` v4 → v5 (then v7)
- `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` v4 → v6
- `docker/setup-buildx-action` v3 → v4
- `docker/build-push-action` v6 → v7

### Additional CI Improvements
- Fork guard prevents accidental nightly runs on forked repositories
- Package-lock.json sync validation added to version-check workflow
- Frontend build caching with split build/deploy steps (nightly)
- Centralized pipeline summary table
- Artifact handling switched from cache to upload/download actions
- Retry logic added to smoke test health checks
- S3 Vector Bucket cleanup added to teardown scripts (nightly)
- CloudWatch log group cleanup added to teardown scripts (nightly)
- Reduced CI log verbosity across all workflows
