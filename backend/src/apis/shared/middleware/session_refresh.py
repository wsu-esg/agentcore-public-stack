"""SessionRefreshMiddleware — unseals the BFF session cookie, optionally
refreshes the underlying Cognito access token, and stashes the resulting
`SessionRecord` on `request.state.bff_session` for downstream dependencies.

Dormant by default: when the request has no `__Host-bff_session` cookie (the
state during Phases 2–5), this is a fast pass-through. When `BFFConfig` is
not enabled (env vars unset, e.g. local dev or pre-Phase-1 environments),
the middleware short-circuits before doing any work.

Refresh-storm coalescing: the per-session `asyncio.Lock` from
`sessions_bff.lock` ensures multiple concurrent requests for the same
session id only trigger one Cognito refresh exchange — without this, N
parallel tab refreshes can tumble each other's refresh tokens.
